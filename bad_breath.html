						<font size="4px">Bad breath, medically called halitosis, can result from poor dental health habits and may be a sign of other health problems. Bad breath can also be made worse by the types of foods you eat and other unhealthy lifestyle habits.</font><br>
						<center><img src="images\bad-breath.jpg" style="width:550px;"></center><br>
						<br><font size="4px"><b>CAUSES OF BAD BREATH:</b></font><br><br>
						<li><b>Poor oral hygiene</b></li>
						<p>The most common cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene. Bacteria that build up on your teeth – particularly between them – as well as your tongue and gums, can produce unpleasant-smelling gases. These bacteria are also responsible for gum disease and tooth decay.</p>
						<p>If you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly, any food trapped between your teeth will be broken down by the bacteria and may be responsible for bad breath.
Bacteria can also live on the rough surface of your tongue. As well as brushing your teeth, cleaning your tongue can also help control bad breath.</p>
                        <p>You should have regular dental check-ups to ensure any oral hygiene problems are picked up and treated early. Your dentist will be able to advise you about how often you need a check-up.</p>
						<li><b>Food and drink</b></li>
						<p>Eating strongly flavoured foods, such as garlic, onions and spices, is likely to make your breath smell. Strong-smelling drinks, such as coffee and alcohol, can also cause bad breath.</p>
						<p>Bad breath caused by food and drink is usually temporary. It can be avoided by not eating or drinking these types of food and drink too often. Good dental hygiene will also help.</p>
						<li><b>Smoking</b></li>
						<p>Smoking is another cause of bad breath. As well as making your breath smell, smoking stains your teeth, irritates your gums, and reduces your sense of taste.</p>
						<p>It can also significantly affect the development of gum disease, another major cause of bad breath. Stopping smoking will lower your risk of gum disease and help prevent bad breath.</p>
						<li><b>Crash dieting</b></p>
						<p>Crash dieting, fasting, and low-carbohydrate diets are another possible cause of bad breath. They cause the body to break down fat, which produces chemicals called ketones that can be smelled on your breath.</p>
						<li><b>Medical conditions</b></li>
						<p>In rare cases, bad breath can be caused by certain medical conditions. In dry mouth (xerostomia), the flow and composition of saliva may be affected.</p>
						<p>A lack of saliva can cause more bacteria than normal to build up in your mouth, as well as a change in the types of bacteria. A build-up of these in the mouth may lead to bad breath.</p>
						<p>Dry mouth can sometimes be caused by a problem in the salivary glands or by breathing through your mouth instead of your nose.</p>
						<p>In some cases, gastrointestinal conditions can also cause bad breath. For example, a bacterial infection of the stomach lining and small intestine (H. pylori infection) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) have been linked to bad breath.</p>
						<p>If a gastrointestinal condition is thought to be causing your bad breath, you may need to have an endoscopy. This is a procedure where a piece of equipment called an endoscope is used to examine an area inside the body, such as your airways or abdomen.</p>
						<p>Other medical conditions that can cause bad breath include diabetes and lung, throat, or nose infections – for example, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, tonsillitis, and sinusitis.</p>
						<li><b>Infections in your mouth</b></li>
						<p>Bad breath can be caused by surgical wounds after oral surgery, such as tooth removal, or as a result of tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores.</p>
						
						<font size="4px"><b>WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR:</b></font>
						<p>If you have bad breath, review your oral hygiene habits. Try making lifestyle changes, such as brushing your teeth and tongue after eating, using dental floss, and drinking plenty of water.</p>
						<p>If your bad breath persists after making such changes, see your dentist. If your dentist suspects a more serious condition is causing your bad breath, he or she may refer you to a physician to find the cause of the odor.</p>
