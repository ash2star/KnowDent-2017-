						<center><img src="E:\wamp\www\KnowDent_modified\KnowDent\images\health_concerns.jpg" style="width:300px;"></center>
						<font size="4px"><b>Common concerns faced by people world-wide</b></font><br>
						<li>Teeth Whitening</li>
						<p>Tooth whitening lightens teeth and helps to remove stains and discoloration. Whitening is among the most popular denatal procedures because it can greatly improve how one's teeth looks. Dentists perform tooth whitening.</p>
						<p>Whitening is not a one-time procedure. It needS to be repeated from time to time if ONE want to maintain the brighter color.</p>
						<li><b>Tensed or Scared to Visit a Dentist</b></li>
						<p>People are abnormally and un-usually scared during a dental visit. This maybe due to a past experience or the cost of visiting a dentist maybe to high and unaffordable.</p>
						<p>But visiting a dentist and telling him about one's fears is considered important at any stage of a dental disease.This may also help lessen one's fears and make the dentist appointment less scary.</p>
						<b>Various dental prodcedures</b>
						<p>Concerns about which procedures need to be carried out WHEN and WHY?</p>
						<strong><b><li>Extractions:</li></b></strong>
						<b>What is an Extraction?</b>
						<p>A dental extraction (also referred to as tooth extraction, exodontia, exodontics, or informally, tooth pulling) is the removal of teeth.Extractions are performed for a wide variety of reasons, but most commonly to remove teeth which have become unrestorable through tooth decay, periodontal disease or dental trauma, especially when they are associated with toothache. Sometimes wisdom teeth are impacted (stuck and unable to grow normally into the mouth) and may cause recurrent infections of the gum (pericoronitis). In orthodontics if the teeth are crowded, sound teeth may be extracted (often bicuspids) to create space so the rest of the teeth can be straightened.</p>
						<b>When and Why?</b>
						<p>If a tooth has been broken or damaged by decay, the dentist will try to fix it with some or another type of dental treatment. But when there's too much damage for the tooth to be repaired, the tooth may need to be extracted — or removed — from its socket in the bone.</p>
						<p>To do so, there are two methods known:
						<li><strong>A simple extraction</strong> – this procedure is on a tooth that can be seen in the mouth. For a simple extraction, the dentist loosens the tooth with an instrument called an elevator. Then the dentist uses forceps to remove the tooth.</li>
						<li><strong>A surgical extraction</strong> – this is a more complex procedure, which is used if a tooth may have broken off at the gum line or has not erupted in the mouth. The oral surgeon will make a small incision into your gum to surgically remove the broken tooth or impacted wisdom tooth.</li>
						</p>
						<strong><b><li>Filling and Repairs:</li></strong></b>
						<b>What are Dental Fillings?</b>
						<p>Fillings helps restore damaged teeth by trying to get it back to their normal function, and prevent further decaying of teeth. The dentist will consider a number of factors when choosing which type of filling material is best for his patient. These factors include the extent of the repair, where the filling is needed and the cost.</p>
						<p>By closing the spaces where bacteria can enter, a filling helps prevent further decay. Materials used for fillings include gold, porcelain, a composite resin (tooth-colored fillings), and an amalgam (an alloy of mercury, silver, copper, tin and sometimes zinc).</p>
						<b>Procedure and types of fillings:</b>
						<p>No one type of filling is best for everyone. What's right for you will be determined by the extent of the repair, whether you have allergies to certain materials, where in your mouth the filling is needed, and the cost. Considerations for different materials include:</p>
						<li><strong>Gold fillings</strong> are made to order in a laboratory and then cemented into place. Gold inlays are well tolerated by gum tissues, and may last more than 20 years. For these reasons, many authorities consider gold the best filling material. However, it is often the most expensive choice and requires multiple visits.</li>
						<li><strong>Amalgam(silver) fillings</strong> are resistant to wear and relatively inexpensive. However, due to their dark color, they are more noticeable than porcelain or composite restorations and are not usually used in very visible areas, such as front teeth.</li>
						<li><strong>Composite(plastic)</strong> resins are matched to be the same color as your teeth and therefore used where a natural appearance is desired. The ingredients are mixed and placed directly into the cavity, where they harden. Composites may not be the ideal material for large fillings as they may chip or wear over time. They can also become stained from coffee, tea or tobacco, and do not last as long as other types of fillings generally from three to 10 years.</li>
						<li><strong>Porcelain fillings</strong> are called inlays or onlays and are produced to order in a lab and then bonded to the tooth. They can be matched to the color of the tooth and resist staining. A porcelain restoration generally covers most of the tooth. Their cost is similar to gold.</li>
						<p>If decay or a fracture has damaged a large portion of the tooth, a crown, or cap, may be recommended. Decay that has reached the nerve may be treated in two ways: through root canal therapy (in which nerve damaged nerve is removed) or through a procedure called pulp capping (which attempts to keep the nerve alive).</p>
